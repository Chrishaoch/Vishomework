This is Vis Homework3 

You can run this program on a local server otherwise the result will not show correctly. And this implementation is not fully met the standard of Homework3 part2. The program lack the function to hide and show the selected therapy. And the box plot position is strange as well.

For the graduate design
The pros are: It shows much more clear for each therapy, instead of overlap much; it also shows the correlation of each attribute better than the basic one.
The con is: it spreads all over the screen make the view messy.
