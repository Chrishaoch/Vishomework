This is Vis Homework3 

Open HaoChen folder, run index.html will pull out the result.
All the changes are made in the file parallel.js

You can run this program on a local server otherwise the result will not show correctly. And this implementation is not fully met the standard of Homework3 part2. The program lack the function to hide and show the selected therapy. And the box plot position is strange as well.

For the Part 1 information, please refer to the file Vis3 Design Info.docx
